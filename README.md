This is a really old code base. We are hoping you can help us improve the codebase.

## What is this project
This is a project built on a very old version of NexJS using design patterns that may be considered obselete.
## What we would do for us.
* Upgrade to the latest version of React.
* Migrate the componens to Functional Components and Hooks
* Make it fully responsive using CSS grids or flex box.
* Createt a docker file that runs the app within a docker Contatiner.
* Deploy the app to Heroku.

##  Steps to follow:

* Fork the repo and make the changes to the forked Repo.

* Send us an email with a link to your github repo and the link to the Heroku app,
